<p>The servants greeted me at the door, rushing in to help. It was a
little amusing I dare add, seeing the confusion on their faces when they
looked at my overused duffel bag. But they were quick to mask it, and
offered me a tour around the mansion. </p>
<p>My uncle used to live here – The Hilton Mansion. He used to bring us
up here when we were young. He didn’t have a family and so he left me
this mansion, and money enough to keep a city running for a decade. </p>
<p>I remembered some of it. The chandelier threatening to weigh down the
ceiling, the windows overlooking the driveway (my brother and I used to
look out the window, waiting for uncle to return from the city with
sweets), the forbidden study we often sneaked into and a stairway so
grand anyone who laid eyes on it would remember it forever.</p>
<p>One of the rooms upstairs was more familiar and later came to realize
it was our old room. The windowsill still had our initials carved into
it. “<em>DH and LH were here</em>”. It was then I heard a soft giggle.
Thinking it was one of the maids I turned around to smile at her. There
was no one.</p>
<p>I went ahead to freshen up; took a stroll, and came back to the room
once I was done with lunch.</p>
<p>Days passed by, with the servants taking me through the work required
in maintaining the mansion, I took a few tours across the backyard.</p>
<p>It was only a few days after I arrived, and I had returned to my room
after lunch that I decided to read my uncle’s diary. Honestly, I was
only having difficulty getting some sleep. I was hoping the diary might
help. Although uncle had asked me to read them immediately, I had put it
off. I did not regret it much, skimming through his daily entries,
writings about having to mow the front lawn for a week as the gardener’s
son was sick.</p>
<p>I don’t remember falling asleep.</p>
<p>The room was dark, cobwebs and grime on the walls. The wallpapers
looked torn, rather than withered. There was a looming figure, I noticed
as my eyes adjusted. He was a doctor; I could see more clearly as I
noticed the scalpel in his hand. He was working on top of what looked
like an altar. Wanting to get a better look I inched sideways, and to my
horror, noticed that he was peeling the skin off of a little girl. Her
screams ricocheted around the room, making them louder with every fresh
pull of her skin.</p>
<p>When I could finally tune into her weeping and screaming, I noticed
him more carefully. He seemed unfazed. Such concentration! The precision
would have been commendable if he wasn’t… skinning a little girl. The
girl was now trying to get out of the ropes, howling in pain.</p>
<p>I was mortified.</p>
<p>And in what seemed like an instant transition, I was skinning her. I
couldn’t control my hands, they moved on their own, scalpel carefully
slicing her skin to peel a new batch.</p>
<p>I woke up with a scream and looked at my hand…almost expecting to see
a bloody scalpel. But I was in my room.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to quiet down, till… I heard hurried footsteps
and voices on the stairway coming up.</p>
<p>Before they walked into the room, I hurriedly hid the diary. They
came in all at once, sweeping the room for threats and comforting me
asking me if I was okay. I reassured them that it was just a horrid
nightmare and was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>I admit I was ashamed to have all their attention on me. I compelled
myself to lie as best as I could and promised them I was fine. After a
while they left rather reluctantly, alarm very evident on their
faces.</p>
<p>A very unusual chill enveloped the room as soon as they left.</p>
<p>The cold was somehow suffocating. I sipped a little water and stared
at the light dancing on the empty glass, willing it to comfort me.</p>
<p>The day went by. It wasn’t till after dinner that I mustered the
courage to pick up the diary once again from under my pillow.</p>
<p>I hadn’t furthered five lines, when I heard the same giggle I had
heard the first day. I looked around. No one was in the room; neither
could they be outside the room, the servants had all gone to bed. I
convinced myself to read further. I noticed a shadow on the diary. I
adjusted the table lamp hoping to move the shadow. I didn’t budge. I
looked back from my chair. There was no one.</p>
<p>I started to feel a little nervous. The air seemed to have changed in
the last few seconds. It was suddenly stagnant and clammy. Suddenly,
there was a soft whisper.</p>
<p>“Come with me.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t move. I had never understood paralysis before, but this
was it. I turned around after what seemed like an eternity. But here was
no one.</p>
<p>“It’s just your imagination.”, I whispered to myself. I told myself
it was the nightmare from earlier today that was messing with my sense
of reality. Despite repeating it to myself over and over again, I was
not convinced.</p>
<p>What was wrong with me?</p>
<p>I went back to reading the diary. After I had read a few entries, one
caught my attention.</p>
<p>An entry about a man skinning a little girl. I was bewildered. I
could relate to every little detail from my recent nightmare. The torn
wallpapers and the grime covered walls. The description bothered me.</p>
<p>I felt slightly nauseous, and I could not bring myself to read on. I
knew that I was just being silly. All of this might only be a
coincidence. But it was more than I could handle. Perplexed, I closed
the diary and went to bed.</p>
<p>It was the same room. The man was kneeling on the floor. He seemed to
be making alterations to the floor. A slight swing of his hands, and I
saw a brush in his hand. I heard a girl crying. I looked around the
room, hoping not to find her. The last time I saw her, most of her skin
was peeled off.</p>
<p>Her chilling scream echoed once again. This time she seemed to be
asking for her mother. <em>She would not find her mother here, poor
child</em>. The crying was fading away.</p>
<p>The man was getting up. He looked back at the floor, while walking
away.</p>
<p>I tried to focus, to see what was on the floor. In the next few
moments, the room came alive. In a momentary lapse, the floor
illuminated with dancing lights. He had lit a few candles it seemed. As
the flames grew bigger, I could finally see what he had drawn.</p>
<p>A reversed pentagram.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I woke up with a start, struggling to protect my eyes against the
light. I regretted not closing the drapes. I sat up on the bed, trying
to collect myself. I could hear birds chirping.</p>
<p>But nothing could shake it off. I was just disturbed, and I couldn’t
do anything about it. Maybe I could, but I didn’t know enough. I rubbed
my eyes. The reversed pentagram appeared to me almost instantly. It was
a sign of the demon. Why would anyone deliberately create it?</p>
<p>But, what if…what if they weren’t just dreams! I had never seen or
heard of dreams like this. Did they mean something? Why did my uncle
have the same dreams as well?</p>
<p>Or maybe, the mansion was playing with my head. It must be the old
creaking walls and the wind whistling in from the back room. I must have
read the diary entry while half asleep and dreamed about it. Yes, that
seemed more probable.</p>
<p>The day passed by quiet and uneventful, that is if you don’t count
the cook spotting a squirrel and mistaking it for a rat in the kitchen.
Boy, did he turn the house upside down!</p>
<p>But that night, the nightmares reappeared.</p>
<p>I was in the same room as last. There were more candles this time and
even though I did not want to look at the floor, I could not help but
notice the reversed pentagram. There was something on it.</p>
<p>I couldn’t breathe. It was the girl, but barely recognizable. There
was not one shred of skin on her body, except on her face. She was
bleeding. I could sense movement, but I had to struggle to take my eyes
off her.</p>
<p>He was kneeling just outside the reversed pentagram. It took some
time for me to realize that he was chanting something. I took my eyes
off the poor girl for a second to find him deep in concentration.</p>
<p>I could hear another sound than the cackling of the flame and his
hushed chanting. It was a slow moan. I did not have to look around to
find the source of the sound; it seemed to be coming from her, although
there seemed to be no movement.</p>
<p>He stopped chanting, taking deep breaths. The candles went out, one
by one. Then room plunged into complete darkness. But he continued
chanting.</p>
<p>A little while later I could see fire again. One candle kindled out
of the blue.</p>
<p>I could see movement on the floor again. The girl was stirring.</p>
<p>I understood what it felt like to be caught. To want to run, yet not
be able to move.</p>
<p>It moved, trying to stand up, blood dripping. And then it smiled.</p>
<p>It suddenly arched back and screamed in pain, eyes closed, and even
though it had no voice, I could hear her scream echo in my head. The
sound breaking bones filled the room as it arched forward, on all four.
Breathing. Panting. Bones penetrated out of its back. It was in pain and
the silence of its screams made it ghastly.</p>
<p>The bones from her back stretched outward, spreading like wings. Then
it stood up.</p>
<p>Its wings were made of bones, covered in blood and ragged flesh. The
limbs sprout more bones. With arms and legs wide, it now finally had
four pair of limbs.</p>
<p>It smiled, in pain, but proud regardless, of what it had achieved.
The skin on its face shed, its smile on flesh. There was no more
blood.</p>
<p>It raised its arms as it watched its nails grow into talons. Then it
turned slowly. Time felt creaking like an old door, as it looked at me
and opened its mouth –the teeth barely visible among the flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I woke up, covered in sweat. Breathing and trying to grasp what
happened. And before I could get out of the bed, I saw it.</p>
<p>Written on the wall. In red.</p>
<p>“RUOY LUOS”</p>
<p>I was awake, but scared to open my eyes. Curled up, I couldn’t bring
myself to. But I had to.</p>
<p>A few of the servants were lined up, looking at me as curiously as
they were when they had heard me scream before.</p>
<p>Before I could bring myself to ask why they were there, one shouted,
“Master scream. So loud. We wake up and come running to see if master
was good.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I looked at the wall. It had nothing on it. I asked them if
they had seen anything when they came in. They all shook their heads in
unison.</p>
<p>I rubbed my eyes, trying to get rid of yesterday’s nightmare. I told
them I was fine and I’d like to have breakfast soon. They comforted me
before they left and said I probably hadn’t gotten used to the mansion
yet. I nodded with a halfhearted smile as they left.</p>
<p>I got up and went to my table and as I pulled out the chair I tried
to remember everything from yesterday. It wasn’t hard, but for the part
where I woke and read the words on the wall. I sat down and closed my
eyes, trying to recollect.</p>
<p>A shadow! I remembered a shadow of a little girl.</p>
<p>The last thing I remembered before I fainted was the shadow of the
little girl beside me.</p>
<p>I opened the diary. I knew what I might find. I skimmed through the
mundane details till I reached the entry which matched what I had seen
last night.</p>
<p>I now had to admit that I was going through similar experiences as my
uncle. In fact, precisely the same –even the soft, fading giggle he had
heard now and again. I heard them too.</p>
<p>I knew I had to find out what was wrong with me before I went
absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>My uncle had made notes of how he visited the library in search of
answers. He knew the library inside out, that shouldn’t have been too
difficult. It was a good thing he made notes, it would have taken me
ages to find the right books.</p>
<p>“I always knew there was something off about having so many used and
tattered books on black magic. I thought at first it was just mere
interests, but after the dreams I’ve had and from what I read today, it
doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>It was a story I had read long before, forgotten, that intrigued me
once again.</p>
<p>My ancestors ruled the little town further down the countryside.
Almost a century or so ago, villagers rebelled, threatening to burn down
the mansion with the Hilton families in it. The family was scared and
did the most reckless thing. They summoned a demon. The evil scared away
the villagers, feasting on those who rebelled.</p>
<p>The family began expanding their rule, using the demon as a weapon to
scare people to submission.</p>
<p>Soon the mutiny faded. But the demon grew in power. It needed blood
to sustain, and when it ran out, it began feasting on the family
members.</p>
<p>A pact was made. An offering by the oldest son in the bloodline every
few years to satiate the demon and keep it from feasting on the family
or otherwise. There was no other way. The knowledge to banish the demon
was lost to time.”</p>
<p>I sighed. I thought I could guess what the dreams were, now. The
demon was demanding a sacrifice.</p>
<p>I poured myself some water as I flipped the page.</p>
<p>“I asked around the town today about my family. They wouldn’t talk at
first… but nothing a little money couldn’t fix. They were clearly afraid
of my forefathers, and went to the lengths of saying everyone in the
mansion always seemed strange.</p>
<p>The old book keeper told me of how there used to be rumors that those
who disobeyed the Hilton family died horrible deaths. He also told me of
how a little girl would disappear from the town every four weeks.</p>
<p>All this cannot be just rumors!”</p>
<p>This was getting beyond crazy. This was black magic. I closed the
book and tried to steady my breath before I could read on. I could tell
whatever came next would not be great.</p>
<p>“My father had sealed the demon. He offered his soul to the demon. A
pure man offering his soul to the demon stops it for over 30 years.</p>
<p>And now the seal is broken and the demon is coming for me.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t thirty years yet. He passed away less than a year back.</p>
<p>So it was safe to assume he couldn’t seal the demon. I flipped
through the next few pages. They were blank. Went through the last pages
again, not wanting to miss any information.</p>
<p>A note slipped out: <em>“I’m terribly sorry, my boy. I couldn’t do
it. The temptation was too much. Forgive me.”</em></p>
<p>That was two days ago.</p>
<p>I haven’t slept a wink since then, scared of what the demon can
do.</p>
<p>I did, against my better judgment, go down to the library to find an
escape. And I did find it. I don’t see any reason to write it down here,
I know my offering will end the curse of the Hilton family forever.</p>
<p>My name is David Hilton and if you are reading this, I’m definitely
dead.</p>
