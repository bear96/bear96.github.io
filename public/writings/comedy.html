<p>Comedy?</p>
<p>I didn’t ask what would happen if I said no. After all, when a gun is
in such close proximity to one’s head, the ramifications of that
recourse are quite obvious even to a man whose academic record could be
summarized as “showed promise, then slept through it.” Not wanting to
die so easily, particularly not in an abandoned warehouse, I instead
asked, with as much calm as I could borrow:</p>
<p>“And what if I did say yes?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the man holding the gun, “that’s quite the win-win
situation, isn’t it? We get to do our business. And you get to become a
millionaire.”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Now, it may be that he intended it pleasantly. He might even have had
a pleasant smile in the abstract, in the same way some suits only look
respectable on shop mannequins. But his teeth were dirty, and his breath
suggested he’d recently been in a passionate embrace with a compost
heap. This rendered his smile singularly unpleasant irrespective of his
intentions.</p>
<p>Behind him, the warehouse stretched out in long, gloomy lines, lit by
one dangling bulb that flickered like a conscience trying to do the
right thing but being shouted down by the rest of the personality.
Stacked all around us were heavy burlap sacks, tied at the top,
stencilled with numbers, and giving off the sort of unspoken menace one
usually associates with bags of cement or particularly judgmental
aunties.</p>
<p>I glanced at them.</p>
<p>He followed my gaze and puffed up slightly, like a schoolboy being
noticed for his stamp collection. “Heroin,” he said, with pride.
“Pure.”</p>
<p>I nodded. One doesn’t like to be rude about a man’s hobbies, even if
his hobbies are illegal, deeply immoral, and liable to ruin the
neighbourhood. Besides, I was currently in a position where rude remarks
might result in a sudden and permanent addition of cranial
ventilation.</p>
<p>“I see,” I said. “And you’re proposing to invite me to join the
family business?”</p>
<p>“You’re a detective,” he said. “A cop. A smart one.”</p>
<p>This was generous. I had, on several occasions, been called clever by
people who meant “he can open jars.” But I let it pass.</p>
<p>“We got a problem,” he went on, “and we need it solved. You solve it,
you get paid.”</p>
<p>“And the alternative?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The alternative is you fall down, you don’t get up.”</p>
<p>I nodded again, as if he were explaining the weather.</p>
<p>At this juncture, I did the one thing I’ve found reliably calms a
room. I took out cigarettes.</p>
<p>I am aware that there are people who will tell you smoking is a
filthy habit and that it shortens the life. But when one is already
staring down the barrel of a gun, the argument about shortened life
feels a bit like criticizing the paintwork on a ship that is actively
sinking. Besides, there is something about the act of smoking that
brings men closer to each other. It bridges a social gap and smooths the
awkwardness, and, in my case, it gives the hands something to do besides
tremble.</p>
<p>I took out two cigarettes and offered the man one.</p>
<p>He accepted it warily, as if it might explode.</p>
<p>I lit mine; he lit his. And then we sat there in the emptying
warehouse full of bags of heroin, smoking in silence, like two old
friends at a railway station who have forgotten why they met but are
determined to see it through on principle.</p>
<p>After a moment, my captor exhaled and said, a little wistfully, “Been
a while since I had a smoke.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes?” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I quit a few months ago.”</p>
<p>“But you’re a drug trafficker,” I said.</p>
<p>He looked at me as if I had just lost my marbles.</p>
<p>“That ain’t no excuse for not quitting,” he said. “Not that I wanted
to quit, mind you. It was my wife.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head sagely. “Ah. Wives,” I said, as one speaks of a
great natural disaster. “They do tend to ruin a laddie’s night-outs, if
you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>He brightened with the sudden relief of a man who has found, at last,
someone who understands the terrible burden of being told not to track
mud into the house.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” he said. “You got a wife?”</p>
<p>Now, here is the thing about my life. I have many qualities that are
useful to the police force, such as stubbornness, patience, and an
ability to drink coffee at temperatures that would melt lesser men. But
I do not have a wife. Nor, if we are being brutally honest, do I have
the sort of romantic history that suggests I was ever in grave danger of
acquiring one by accident.</p>
<p>Still, men in my line of work develop a knack for improvisation. I
could have lied. I could have invented a luminous creature named
Florence or Mabel who lived for scolding me and making me eat
vegetables. I could have been, in that moment, a married man.</p>
<p>But the gun was very close, the warehouse was very empty, and
something about the trafficker’s mournful face struck a chord in me. It
was the chord of male solidarity, which is an instrument that plays only
two tunes: “I’ve been there” and “No one will ever understand.”</p>
<p>So I sighed, and told him the truth.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “No wife.”</p>
<p>He paused. Smoke drifted up and caught in the light, like a ghost
trying to eavesdrop.</p>
<p>“Girlfriend?” he tried, hopeful.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“Mistress? A little side piece? A someone who texts you at night and
says ‘U up’?”</p>
<p>“Not even that,” I said. “My romantic life could be written on a
postage stamp, and you’d still have room for a picture of the king.”</p>
<p>He stared at me.</p>
<p>Then, and this is the remarkable part, the gun lowered by about half
an inch. His shoulders sagged. His face softened in the way people’s
faces soften when they see a three-legged dog trying to climb
stairs.</p>
<p>“Damn,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>I took a drag from my cigarette. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“How old are you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Old enough to be disappointed in myself,” I said.</p>
<p>He made a sound that was not quite a laugh and not quite a sob.
“Brother,” he said, “that’s rough.”</p>
<p>It is a curious thing, but pity is a more powerful weapon than fear.
I had spent years cultivating an aura of hard-boiled menace, of being
the sort of detective who can stare down a suspect with a single raised
eyebrow and make him confess to crimes he hasn’t even committed yet. Yet
in this warehouse, surrounded by heroin sacks and moral ruin, it was my
utter lack of being loved by a woman that finally disarmed a man with a
gun.</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, listen. I’m sorry I
put the gun to your head.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” I said magnanimously, because once a man has
pitied you, it feels petty to nitpick about the gun.</p>
<p>“No, I mean it,” he insisted. “I got my problems. But you, man, you
got a whole situation.”</p>
<p>I nodded, as if being unloved were a case file.</p>
<p>He flicked ash onto the concrete. “My wife,” he began, and then the
floodgates opened.</p>
<p>It came out in a torrent. The nagging, the suspicion, the constant
interrogations about where he’d been and why his shirt smelled like
“chemicals and sin.” The demands that he stop smoking, stop drinking,
stop coming home at dawn with mysterious bruises and even more
mysterious cash. Her insistence that he attend couples therapy, which he
described as “two people paying a stranger to tell me I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>“And she don’t even appreciate the good parts,” he said bitterly.
“I’m a provider. I got ambition. I’m riskin’ my life out here.”</p>
<p>“With bags,” I said, gesturing to the sacks.</p>
<p>“With bags,” he agreed. “And what do I get? ‘Why is there powder in
your shoes?’ ‘Why are there men in the driveway?’ ‘Why is our bank
account full of cash?’ Like I’m the bad guy.”</p>
<p>I exhaled slowly. “Marriage,” I said, with the air of a philosopher
from France in the 1950s.</p>
<p>“Exactly!”</p>
<p>I could see the shape of the problem now. It wasn’t police work. It
wasn’t even crime. It was domesticity, a field more treacherous than any
alleyway, because at least in an alleyway you know where the knife is
coming from.</p>
<p>He added grimly. “She’s on to me. She says if I don’t go clean, she’s
taking the kids and leaving. And she says she’s gonna go to the
cops.”</p>
<p>“That does seem inconvenient,” I said.</p>
<p>He stared at the floor. “I love my kids,” he said. “I love my wife
too, even if she’s a nightmare in sweatpants. I don’t want to lose
’em.”</p>
<p>I looked at him, this criminal, this trafficker, this man with the
breath of tragedy, and I felt, absurdly, a tug of sympathy. Here was a
fellow human being whom life had decidedly kicked in the nuts and let
him fall to a cushion. We smoked in commiserative silence while I racked
my brains for some inspiration. Then it hit me. An idea, I mean.</p>
<p>“What you need,” I said slowly, “is leverage.”</p>
<p>He perked up. “Yeah? Like blackmail?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “Not that kind of leverage.” One tries to steer the
conversation away from additional felonies when possible. “I mean a
compromise.”</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes, suspicious again. “You’re a cop.”</p>
<p>“I’m a detective,” I corrected him. “There’s a difference. Cops
arrest people. Detectives negotiate with fate.”</p>
<p>He stared at me as if I had begun reciting poetry.</p>
<p>“Listen,” I said, leaning forward slightly. “Your wife wants you
clean, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You want to keep your family.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You also want,” I added, gesturing to the warehouse, “to keep doing
this.”</p>
<p>He hesitated, then nodded. “This is what I’m good at.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I said sympathetically, as one might say to a man who
insists he’s excellent at juggling knives. “So here’s your compromise.
You quit the smoking.”</p>
<p>“But I already quit the smoking,” he said miserably.</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. “But you quit the smoking even more. As in, make it
dramatic. Join a support group. Bring home pamphlets. Cry once. Wives
love tears, but only if they feel earned. Then you tell her you’re
taking up something wholesome. Like woodworking.”</p>
<p>He blinked. “Woodworking?”</p>
<p>“Very marital,” I said. “Lots of men suddenly develop a passion for
sanding when their wives threaten divorce. You can make a little
birdhouse. The children love birdhouses. The wife sees it and thinks,
‘My husband is becoming a better man.’ Meanwhile…”</p>
<p>I let the word hang in the air.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile?” he prompted.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile,” I said, “you keep doing business. But you do it smarter
and quieter. And you make it look like you’re broke. Start complaining
about money. Moan about the price of groceries. She’ll be too busy
worrying about coupons to wonder why your shoes smell like villainy. And
naturally, the powder on your clothes is just from woodworking.”</p>
<p>He stared at me. His cigarette burned down, forgotten.</p>
<p>“That’s brilliant,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“I’ve read novels,” I said modestly.</p>
<p>He sat back, looking stunned. “And what, you’ll also help me? Like
you’ll keep the cops off my back?”</p>
<p>Now, at this point, the morally correct thing would have been to
stand up, knock him unconscious with something heavy, and call in the
entire department. But morality, like the warehouse light, was
flickering.</p>
<p>Also, there was still the matter of the gun, which he had not
entirely put away, and which I had grown to dislike.</p>
<p>“I can’t do miracles,” I said carefully. “But I can influence things.
Cases get lost. Paperwork goes missing. Evidence gets misplaced.”</p>
<p>He nodded fervently. “Yeah. Yeah. That’s what I need.”</p>
<p>“And in exchange,” I said, “I become a millionaire, yes?”</p>
<p>He smiled again, and this time it was almost pleasant, because pity
had cleaned some of the grime off his soul.</p>
<p>“How much you want?” he asked.</p>
<p>Now, one must be sensible. I am not greedy by nature. I have always
felt that greed leads to trouble, and trouble leads to paperwork, and
paperwork leads to death.</p>
<p>So I said, “Ten percent.”</p>
<p>He blinked. “Ten?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “I’m a modest man. Also, I have no wife. I don’t need to
fund anyone’s Pilates.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought he might argue. Then his face creased with
that same pity again, the pity that was quickly becoming my most
effective weapon.</p>
<p>“Ten percent,” he agreed solemnly, like a man offering alms.</p>
<p>And then, this is how the world ends, not with a bang but with two
men shaking hands in a heroin warehouse, he extended his hand.</p>
<p>I took it.</p>
<p>His palm was rough. His grip was firm. His breath was still an
international incident, but one can’t have everything.</p>
<p>“Name’s Vince,” he said.</p>
<p>I gave him mine.</p>
<p>He nodded. “You’re alright,” he said.</p>
<p>“You too,” I said, and meant it in the strange way people mean things
in stories where the moral compass has been replaced by a slightly tipsy
weathervane.</p>
<p>He picked up the gun again, but this time not to threaten me. Merely
to tuck it away with the casualness of a man putting on a hat.</p>
<p>“Go on,” he said. “Get outta here. And hey.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” I said.</p>
<p>He hesitated, then said awkwardly, “You’ll find someone.”</p>
<p>I laughed, an honest laugh, the sort I hadn’t made in years.
“Perhaps,” I said. “Or perhaps I’ll take up woodworking.”</p>
<p>He grinned.</p>
<p>I walked out into the cold night air, my coat collar up, my heart
feeling bizarrely light for a man who had just agreed to accept a cut of
drug profits. Behind me, the warehouse door shut with a hollow
clang.</p>
<p>And as I headed down the empty street, I couldn’t help thinking:
society had lost, certainly. Justice had taken a bruising. The law was
lying in a ditch somewhere, asking for a cigarette.</p>
<p>But humanity, flawed, ridiculous, pitiable humanity, had won.</p>
<p>And sometimes, in this rotten world, that’s the closest thing to a
happy ending you’re going to get.</p>
